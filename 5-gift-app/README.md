## Description

This is a gift-finding app that recommends gifts to the user based on the type of relationship they have with the person they want to give a present to and the hobbies/interests that that person has. 

As soon as the user reaches the app’s “home”, they can select the type of person they want to buy a gift for: family member, partner, friend, etc. From this choice, a submenu goes into more detail, while also giving the user a search bar to expedite the categorization process, if needed. Next, the user can select what the person likes and from there, they are presented with a list of gifts categorized by the hobbies/interests they previously selected.

The user can further filter the search results by specific hobbies, reviews, budget, offers, etc. On the bottom menu, there is a calendar option where a user can save special dates such as birthdays and set a reminder to get a gift for that person.

Once an item is selected, the user chooses whether to have it delivered or to pick it up. These fields are marked as required and an error state will alert the user if this information is not selected before moving on. If the user chooses pick-up, they are prompted to select a shop  location from a map. The user can also add optional services like gift wrapping or a personalized card, at extra cost.

Finally, when the user buys the gift, they can make a direct payment with Apple Pay and they are led to a confirmation page. 

## Persona: Thoughtful Theresa

Name: Teresa
Age: 28
Occupation: Teacher
Location: Nashville

### Goals
_What does the person want to accomplish?_

- Values close connections, whether it be family and new or old time friends. She is a very social person and enjoys sharing her free time with others.
- Enjoys celebrating her friends and making them feel special and valued, in particular since the pandemic separated many relationships and made it more difficult to keep close contact. 
- Believes in the importance of giving a gift that shows she took the time to find something that her friend wanted, would be useful or make her happy, rather than giving generic gifts.

### Frustrations
_What gets in their way? What are areas of friction?_

- As an elementary school teacher, she is busier than ever because children are lagging behind in their education as a result of the pandemic. She finds she doesn’t have the time or the energy to search for the perfect gift or to go from store to store, like she always did.
- Arriving exhausted from work and the constant planning to keep her students up to date have left her mind with little space for anything else. This means she is now constantly forgetting about her family and friend’s special occasions, which saddens her as she used to be very on top of things.
- The spike in gas prices makes her search for a gift more expensive than the gift itself and she can no longer afford going from store to store to search for the right gift. 
- When she had a more manageable schedule, she used to plan in advance the gifts she would get for her loved ones for holidays such as Christmas. This helped her find the best deals ahead of time. Now, she’s too busy to do this and she is worried it is going to pile up on her when it’s too late.
