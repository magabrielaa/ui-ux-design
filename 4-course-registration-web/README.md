## Application and Graphic Design Principles

### Navigation

- From sign up form to list of courses
- From each course to more info (demo only for the top row)
- From course additional info back to list of courses
- From registration pages to the cart
- From cart to registration confirmation
- From registration confirmation to login (for re-entry) 

### Forms
- Inline error message for an invalid email and password that doesn’t match

### Hierarchy
- Differently sized headlines to draw attention in order of importance
- Montserrat for titles, Arial for text
- Bigger pictures/components for more important elements

### Layout
- Z-reading patterns

### Typography
- Line height and spacing

### Color
- Adhered to UChicago colors and used Coolors to generate a color scheme (yellow and blue along with maroon and gray)
- Reds used for selections, grays for unselected options
- Bright red used for error messages in sign up form
