# ONBOARDING AND USER RETENTION

View [prototype design](https://www.figma.com/proto/0QTpjaDId0fRIXrH3C8PZo/Assignment-6?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=105%3A4222&viewport=1574%2C477%2C0.31&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=105%3A3965)

## Description

From the previous iteration, I added the following:

### Onboarding

- The app starts with three frames that explain the main features of the app
- At every point the user can Skip and “Get Started”
- The user can either sign up or log in (in the latter case assuming the user logged out of the application)

### Retention

- The user can accumulate points, which they can later redeem for prizes
- After signing up, the user earns their first 25 points as motivation
- At the end of a purchase, the user earns additional points
- Within the home buttons, the user can navigate to the rewards page at any point

### Feedback incorporations
- I added an app loading screen at the beginning with the name of the app and a logo

    - _Note:_  Since it’s animated with a timed after delay, sometimes it doesn’t show on the prototype mode (it shows on my Figma but when I test it externally with the link sometimes it starts with the second frame).

- I increased the size of the calendar as big as the size of the screen. Since the assignment is to use Native app components, this is the only calendar component I could find. I tested the distance between the dates with the prototype loaded on my phone.
